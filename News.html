            <p class="diff">‚ÄúIt's already the best stadium in the world and it will continue to be so. You can see how it's going to be when it's finished in the images and it looks amazing. I can't wait to play in it, I hope I can have a few years playing in the new stadium". <br> <br> On the scoresheet against Rayo
                "I like scoring goals too, especially at the Bernab√©u, but I'm not the guy who gets the goals. As a midfielder, it's important to score every now and then, but I think I can give other more important things to the team and that's what I try to do. I'm not the right player to rely on for goals because I don't get many".</p>

            <h2>Real Madrid comes out with a difficult and important win on his court</h2>
            <p class="diff">German Toni Kroos scored Real Madrid's first goal in the 15th minute, after receiving a superb pass from Marco Asensio, and the referee awarded the goal after returning to the video technology, after he initially indicated that there was an offside on Vinicius before passing the ball to Asensio.
                <br>
                <br>
                French star Karim Benzema scored the second goal for Real in the 38th minute, after a magic pass from David Alaba, to strengthen the top scorer in the Spanish League with 10 goals.
                And Toni Kross has man of the match award.
                <br>
               <br>
                In the second half, veteran Colombian striker Radamel Falcao scored Rayo Vallecano's only goal in the 77th minute with a header, taking his tally to 5 goals this season.
               
                With this result, Real Madrid grabs the top of the Spanish league standings with 27 points
