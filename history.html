            <h2>Early years (1897‚Äì1945)</h2>
            <p class="diff">
                The city of Madrid was introduced to football by the professors and students of the "Free Education Foundation" educational center ( Spanish : Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza ), who were graduates of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in Britain.  the foundations of those professors and students team in the city in 1897 and named it "Team Sky Football" ( English : Football Club the Sky ), and they were playing ball every day one day in the "Moncloa" area located in Madrid.  In 1900 , the team was divided into two different: one team called " The New Madrid Football" ( English : New Foot-Ball De of Madrid ) and the other team called Madrid (In English : Club Espa√±ol de Madrid ).  The last team was divided again in 1902, to establish the "Madrid Football Club" (in English : Madrid Football Club ), now known as Real Madrid, and that was on March 6, 1902 .  Three years after its founding, in 1905, the team called "Madrid Club de Football" won its first official local championship, after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final .  team managed to maintain the championship title for four consecutive years (since this tournament was the only official tournament held at the time).
            </p class="diff">
            <p class="diff">The club was one of the founding membersThe Spanish Football Federation on January 4, 1909 , where the team was represented by its president, Adolfo Melendez, to sign the agreement establishing the federation.  In 1912, the team moved to its new stadium called "O'Donnell Square" ( Spanish : Campo de O'Donnell ), after it had previously moved from one place to another due to the lack of a private stadium.  In 1920, the name of the team was modified by King Alfonso XIII of Spain to become Real Madrid, where he was given the title "Real", which means "royal" to the team. 
            </p>
            <p class="diff">
                In 1929, the Spanish Football League was launched , and Real Madrid led the standings until the last match of the season, but lost the last match against Athletic Bilbao in San Mam√©s and consequently lost its lead and the championship. He was runner-up at the time, Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãby one point.  Real Madrid won the first league championship in its history in the 1931-32 season , and followed it in the following season by winning the championship again, becoming the first team to win the league championship twice in a row since its inception.

In the following year, the club developed training matters and launched the Galacticos era, during which Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luis Figo, Roberto Carlos, Raul and David Beckham attended . This policy did not fulfill the hopes held at the time, although the club won the Champions League in the 2001‚Äì02 season and the League Championship the following season, as well as the Spanish Super Cup in 2004, but it failed to win titles for three years after that.

Real Madrid won the La Liga title in 2007 after a four-year hiatus, but Fabio Capello was abandoned.  In the following season, the white team won the League championship again, and this was the thirty-first time that it had won the championship, which recorded Real Madrid winning two consecutive championships for the first time in 18 years.
